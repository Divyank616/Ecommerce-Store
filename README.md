E-Commerce Platform using Flask

This project is a fully functional e-commerce web application built using Flask as the backend framework. The platform allows users to register and log in, browse various products, add items to a cart, and place orders. Each user’s data is managed individually through a connected database, ensuring proper handling of user sessions, orders, and inventory.

The backend handles product listings, user authentication, order processing, and database balancing to maintain consistency and reliability. Flask routes and RESTful APIs are used to connect the frontend with the backend logic, while the database ensures persistent storage of users, products, and transactions. The project demonstrates core concepts of web development, backend architecture, and database management.
